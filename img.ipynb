    "# Interferometry Image Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a minimal image reconstruction algorithm for interferometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I(\\alpha, \\beta)$ be an image on the sky.\n",
    "Interferometry allows astronomer to sample the Fourier transform of the image $\\hat{I}(u, v) = \\int\\int I(\\alpha,\\beta) \\exp[-2\\pi i(u\\alpha + v\\beta)] d\\alpha d\\beta$ along the $uv$-tracks $[u_{ab}(t), v_{ab}(t)]$ for telescopes $a$ and $b$ at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a small number of telescope locations, we have a sparse set of $uv$ tracks, which sample the Fourier transform of the image.\n",
    "We call these sampled Fourier coefficients the visibility $V_{abj} = \\hat{I}(u_{ab}(t_n), v_{ab}(t_n)$ for all $a$, $b$, and $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of interferometry image reconstruction is to receover the original sky image $I(\\alpha, \\beta)$ to the best we can, based on the visibility $\\{V_{abj}\\}$."
